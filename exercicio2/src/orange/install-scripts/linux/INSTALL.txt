ORANGE:
DATA MINING FRUITFUL AND FUN
==========================================

Prerequisites
==========================================
In order to run Orange Canvas - the visual programming front end of
Orange - you will need to have Qt, PyQt installed. On Fedora Core 3
these libraries can be installed by executing the following command:

     yum groupinstall "KDE Software Development"


Running Orange Canvas
==========================================
The system installation should create a shortcut to Orange Canvas, a
script: 

/usr/bin/orange 

which is equivalent to executing the following command (the path might
vary among Linux distributions):

python /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/orange/OrangeCanvas/orngCanvas.pyw


Installation Instructions
==========================================
Get the .tgz file. After unpacking go to the top-level
directory.

The binary distribution is prepared in Fedora Core 3. In case you need
to recompile for your distribution of Linux, follow the instructions
on how to compile from source. Sources are included in the binary
distribution.

Orange can be installed in two ways: locally in a user directory or in
the system directories.

1. SYSTEM INSTALLATION
   Using Python for which you wish to install Orange, execute as
   root:

     python setup.py install

   Depending on the Linux distribution you are using you should get
   something like this:

   Orange files:
   /usr/lib/python3.2/site-packages/orange

   Path file to Orange used by Python:
   /usr/lib/python3.2/site-packages/orange/orange.pth

   Documentation, data sets, etc.:
   /usr/share/doc/orange

   Links to .so files:
   /usr/lib/

   Shortcut to Orange Canvas:
   /usr/bin/orange


2. USER, LOCAL INSTALLATION

   Using Python for which you wish to install Orange, execute as
   normal user:

     python setup.py install --orangepath=<target directory where orange directory should be created>

   You should get the following structure:

   Orange files:
   <target dir>/orange/

   Documentation, data sets, etc.:
   <target dir>/doc/
   
   Path file to Orange used by Python:
   orange.pth                

   See the Distutils documentation for many command-line options as to
   installation locations, etc.

The setup.py script will hint you where to get the various prerequisites 
needed by Orange and Orange Canvas: Numeric, GSL, Qt, PyQt, PyQwt, etc.


Building and Installing Orange from Source
==========================================
Using Python for which you wish to install Orange, execute:

     python setup.py compile

Then follow the Installation Instructions (see above).


Uninstalling Orange
==========================================
Depending on the type of installation you should be root or normal
user, execute:

python <DOC installation directory>/setup.py uninstall

<DOC installation directory> is usually /usr/share/doc/orange, but
might be different depending on your Linux distribution.

This will remove Orange, Orange Canvas, Orange documentation and links to
Orange libraries.
