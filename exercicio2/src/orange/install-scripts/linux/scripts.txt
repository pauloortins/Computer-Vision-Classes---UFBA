###### core scripts, used daily to build and test Orange
* compileRegress.sh:
	Used on george. It checks-out orange, sources, docs and widgets. It then compiles orange, installs it localy (user-level install), and runs the regression tests. Email is sent in case of failure. Called daily at 7am.

* copyLogsToWeb.sh:
	Called after compileRegress.sh to publish all logs on web, http://george.fri.uni-lj.si/orange.

* testOrange.sh:
	Called by compileRegress.sh to test the user-level install (in the /home/orange/daily/test_install/orange directory).

* createSnapshot.sh:
	Called daily (from estelle) to create Linux snapshots, binary, source-only, bcm, genomics versions. It calls createOrangeDist.sh to do the actual work. It then publishes the results on the estelle download web page.

* createOrangeDist.sh:
	Creates a source or binary distribution of Orange (normal, bcm, genomics).


##### more or less useful scripts
* compileInteractive.sh:
	Call this script to check-out all source (into /home/orange/interactive/orange directory) and run "python setup.py compile".
