.. _Concatenate:

Concatenate
===========

.. image:: ../icons/Concatenate.png

Concatenates data from multiple sources.

Signals
-------

Inputs:
   - Primary Table (ExampleTable)
      A data set that defines the attribute set and gives the examples
   - Additional Tables (ExampleTable)
      Additional tables of examples

Outputs:
   - Examples (ExampleTable)


Description
-----------

The widget concatenates multiple sets of examples. The merge is "vertical", in
a sense that two sets of 10 and 5 examples yield a new set of 15 examples.

In case one of the tables is connected to the widget as the primary table, the
resulting table will contain these same attributes. If there is no primary
table, the attributes can be either a union of all attributes that appear in
the tables specified as "Additional Tables", or their intersection, that is, a
list of attributes which appear in all the connected tables.


Example
-------

The widget can be used, for instance, for merging the data coming from three
separate files, as shown below.
