Replaces unknown values in the data.

Signals
-------

Inputs:

   - Examples (ExampleTable)
      Data set.

   - Learner for Imputation
      A learning algorithm to be used when values are imputed using a
      predictive model. This algorithm, if given, substitutes the default
      (1-NNLearner).


Outputs:

   - Examples (ExampleTable)
      The same data set as on the input, but with the missing values imputed.


Description
-----------

Some Orange's algorithms and visualization cannot handle unknown values in the
data. This widget does what statistician call imputation: it substitutes them
by values computed from the data or set by the user.

In the top-most box, :obj:`Default imputation method`, the user can specify a
general imputation technique for all attributes.

   - :obj:`Don't Impute` does nothing with the missing values.

   - :obj:`Average/Most-frequent` uses the average value (for continuous
     attributes) or the most common value (for discrete attributes).

   - :obj:`Model-based imputer` constructs a model for predicting the missing
     value based on values of other attributes; a separate model is constructed
     for each attribute. The default model is 1-NN learner, which takes the
     value from the most similar example (this is sometimes referred to as hot
     deck imputation). This algorithm can be substituted by one that the user
     connects to the input signal :obj:`Learner for Imputation`. Note, however,
     that if there are discrete and continuous attributes in the data, the
     algorithm needs to be capable of handling them both; at the moment only
     kNN learner can do that. (In the future, when Orange has more regressors,
     Impute widget may have separate input signals for discrete and continuous
     models.)

   - :obj:`Random values` computes the distributions of values for each
     attribute and then imputes by picking random values from them.

   - :obj:`Remove examples with missing values` removes the example containing
     missing values, except for the attributes for which specific actions are
     defined as described below. This check also applies to the class attribute
     if :obj:`Impute class values` is checked.



It is also possible to specify individual treatment for each attribute which
override the default treatment set above. One can also specify a manually
defined value used for imputation. In the snapshot on the left, we decided not
to impute the values of "normalized-losses" and "make", the missing values of
"aspiration" will be replaced by random values, while the missing values of
"body-style" and "drive-wheels" are replaced by "hatchback" and "fwd",
respectively. If the values of "length", "width" or "height" is missing,
the example is discarded. Values of all other attributes use the default
method set above (model-based imputer, in our case).

Button :obj:`Set All to Default` resets the individual attribute treatments
to the default.

Imputing class values is typically not a good practice, so it is off by
default. It can be enabled by checking :obj:`Impute class values`. If checked
and the default method is to remove the examples with missing values, then
also examples with unknown classes are removed; otherwise they are not.

All changes are committed immediately is :obj:`Send automatically` is checked.
Otherwise, :obj:`Apply` needs to be pushed to apply any new settings.
