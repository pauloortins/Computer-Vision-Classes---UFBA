Merge Data

Merges two data sets based on the values of selected attributes.

Signals
-------

Inputs:


   - Examples A (ExampleTable)
      Attribute-valued data set.
   - Examples B (ExampleTable)
      Attribute-valued data set.


Outputs:


   - Merged Examples A+B (ExampleTable)
      Attribute-valued data set composed from instances from input data A
      which are appended attributes from input data B and their values
      determined by matching the values of the selected attributes.
   - Merged Examples B+A (ExampleTable)
      Attribute-valued data set composed from instances from input data
      B which are appended attributes from input data A and their values
      determined by matching the values of the selected attributes.


Description
-----------

Merge Data widget is used to horizontally merge two data sets based on the
values of selected attributes. On input, two data sets are required, A and B.
The widget allows for selection of an attribute from each domain which will be
used to perform the merging. When selected, the widget produces two outputs,
A+B and B+A. The first output (A+B) corresponds to instances from input
data A which are appended attributes from B, and the second output (B+A)
to instances from B which are appended attributes from A.

The merging is done by the values of the selected (merging) attributes. For
example, instances from from A+B are constructed in the following way.
First, the value of the merging attribute from A is taken and instances
from B are searched with matching values of the merging attributes. If
more than a single instance from B is found, the first one is taken and
horizontally merged with the instance from A. If no instance from B match
the criterium, the unknown values are assigned to the appended attributes.
Similarly, B+A is constructed.

Examples
--------

Below is an example that loads spot intensity data from microarray
measurements and spot annotation data. While microarray data consists of
measurements of several spots representing equal DNA material (denoted by
equal :obj:`Spot ID's`), the annotation data consists of a single line
(instance) for each spot.

Merging the two data sets results in annotations appended to each spot
intensity datum. The :obj:`Spot intensities` data is connected to
:obj:`Examples A` input of the :ref:`Merge Data` widget, and the
:obj:`Spot annotations` data to the :obj:`Examples B` input. Both outputs
of the :ref:`Merge Data` widget are then connected to the :ref:`Data Table`
widget. In the latter, the :obj:`Merged Examples A+B` are shown.
The attributes between :obj:`Spot ID` and :obj:`BG {Ref}`, including these
two, are from the :obj:`Spot intensities` data set (:obj:`Examples A`),
while the last three are from the :obj:`Spot annotations` data set
(:obj:`Examples B`). Only instances representing non-control DNA (these
with :obj:`Spot ID` equal to :obj:`ST_Hs_???`) received annotations, while
for the others (:obj:`Spot ID = ST_Cr_048`), no annotation data exists in
the :obj:`Spot annotations` data and unknown values were assigned to the
appended attributes.

Hint
----

If the two data sets consists of equally-named attributes (others than the
ones used to perform the merging), Orange will by default check for
consistency of the values of these attributes and report an error in
case of non-matching values. In order to avoid the consistency checking,
make sure that new attributes are created for each data set: you may use
"... Always create a new attribute" option in the :ref:`File` widget for
loading the data.
