Visualizes distances between items

Signals
-------

Inputs:
   - Distance Matrix (SymMatrix)
      A distance matrix


Outputs:
   - Examples (ExampleTable)
      Examples corresponding to selected elements of the matrix
   - Attribute List (orange.VarList)
      Attributes corresponding to selected elements of the matrix


Description
-----------

Distance Map is a visualization of distances between objects. The visualization
is rather simple: it is the same as is we printed out a table of numbers,
except that the numbers are replaced by spots colored by colors from the
specified palette.

The distances are most often distances between examples (for instance from
:ref:`Example Distance` or attributes (for instance from
:ref:`Attribute Distance`. The widget does not require that (another option
can be loading the distances from a file using :ref:`Distance File`, although
when one of these is the case, the user can select a region of the map and the
widget will output the corresponding examples or attributes through the
appropriate signal.

The snapshot shows distances between attributes in the heart disease data,
using the preset Black - Red palette, where smaller numbers are represented
with black and larger with red. The matrix is symmetric and the diagonal is
black - no attribute is different from itself. The former (symmetricity) is
always assumed, while the diagonal may also be non-zero.

The widget's settings are divided into three tabs. The first one defines the
size and order of cells. :obj:`Width` and :obj:`Height` in the :obj:`Cell Size`
box set the size of the cells. The cells can be restricted to squares
(:obj:`Cells as squares`) and drawn with or without gridlines in between
(:obj:`Show grid`). When cells are too small (8 pixels or less), the grid
disappears in any case.

:obj:`Merge` merges multiple cells into a single cell, which can be useful
when the matrix is too large. For this option to yield meaningful results,
items need to be sorted so similar items are merged. The widget has three
options; it can leave the items as they are (:obj:`No sorting`) it can put
similar items together (:obj:`Adjacent distance`) or randomly shuffle the
items (:obj:`Random order`). Of these, adjacent distance is unfortunately not
implemented yet.

The second tab defines the colors that represent the numeric values.
:obj:`Gamma` defines how numbers are mapped onto the palette colors.
When set to 1 (default), the mapping is linear. When it decreases, the numeric
values at the lower end get similar colors, the curve get steeper in the
middle, and higher values are again represented with colors which are more
similar than if gamma was higher. The graph below shows the mapping function
at gamma=0.25.

Setting gamma is useful when the distribution of distances has long tails which
are not very interested. The widget also offers controls for cutting of the
outliers. Normally, the color palette is used to visualize the entire range
of distances appearing in the matrix. This can be changed be checking
:obj:`Enable thresholds` and setting the low and high threshold. Distances
outside this interval are then shown using special colors, so the color
spectrum can be used for visualizing the interesting part of the distribution.

The widget supports different color schemes. The built-in schemes are named
:obj:`Blue - Yellow`, :obj:`Black - Red` and :obj:`Green - Black - Red`. The
schema is defined, first, by the two colors representing the lowest and
highest distances. The two colors are set by clicking the rectangles to the
left and right of the color strip below the schema name. The transition can go
either from one color to another (in the RGB space) or
:obj:`Pass through black`, that is, from one color to black and then to
another. Colors can also be set for undefined values (:obj:`N/A`), values
below and above the low and high thresholds (:obj:`Underflow` and
:obj:`Overflow`), the background (:obj:`Background`), the outline of the cell
under the mouse cursor (:obj:`Cell outline`) and the marker around the selected
region (:obj:`Selected cells`).

User can modify the existing schemata and also create new, customized schemata
(:obj:`New`). The built-in schemata are shown below.

The last tab defines the shown information and controls selection of cells.
:obj:`Show legend` determines whether the widget shows the colored strip at
the top which shows the mapping of numbers into colors. :obj:`Show labels`
shows and hides the item names (e.g. age, gender etc) besides the map. Labels
can only be shown it they exist; they do when the data represents distances
between attributes or when the data is loaded from a labeled distance file.

If :obj:`Show balloon` is checked, a ballon appears when the mouse is hovering
over a cell, which shows the numerical distances and, if
:obj:`Display item names` is checked, also the names of the corresponding
items.

The user can select a region in the map by the usual click-and-drag with the
mouse. When a part of the map is selected, the widget output all items
corresponding to the selected cells. The three buttons in the :obj:`Select`
can undo the last selection, remove all selections and send the selected
data. If :obj:`Send after mouse release` is checked, the data is set
automatically, without needing to press the button above.

Examples
--------

The above snapshots were obtained by the following schema:

The file widget loads the iris data set; we then compute the attribute
distances and visualize them.
