Various linear projection methods with explorative data analysis and
intelligent data visualization enhancements.

Signals
-------

Inputs:
   - Examples (ExampleTable)
      Input data set.
   - Example Subset (ExampleTable)
      A subset of data instances from Examples.
   - Attribute Selection List
      List of attributes to be shown in the visualization.


Outputs:
   - Selected Examples (ExampleTable)
      A subset of examples that user has manually selected from the scatterplot.
   - Unselected Examples (ExampleTable)
      All other examples (examples not included in the user's selection).
   - Attribute Selection List
      List of attributes used in the visualization.


Warning: this widget combines a number of visualization methods that are
currently in research. Eventually, it will break down to a set of simpler
widgets, each implementing its own method.

Description
-----------

This widget provides an interface to a number of linear projection methods that
all deal with class-labeled data and aim at finding the two-dimensional
projection where instances of different classes are best separated. Consider,
for a start, a projection of a **zoo.tab** data set (animal species and their
features) shown below. Notice that it is breast-feeding (milk) and hair that
nicely characterizes mamals from the other organisms, and that laying eggs is
something that birds do. This specific visualization was obtained using FreeViz
([1]_), while the widget also implements an interface to supervised
principal component analysis ([2]_), partial least squares (for a nice
introduction, see [3]_), and RadViz visualization and
associated intelligent data visualization technique called VizRank 
([4]_)

Projection search methods are invoked from :obj:`Optimization Dialogs` in the
:obj:`Main` tab. Other controls in this tab and controls in the :obj:`Settings`
tab are just like those with other visualization widgets; please refer to a
documentation of :ref:`Scatter Plot` widget for further information.

:obj:`FreeViz` button in :obj:`Main` tab opens a dialog from which four
different methods are accessed. The first one is FreeViz, which uses a paradigm
borrowed from particle physics: points in the same class attract each other,
those from different class repel each other, and the resulting forces are
exerted on the anchors of the attributes, that is, on unit vectors of each of
the dimensional axis. The points cannot move (are projected in the projection
space), but the attribute anchors can, so the optimization process is a
hill-climbing optimization where at the end the anchors are placed such that
forces are in equilibrium. The FreeViz optimization dialog is used to invoke
the optimization process (:obj:`Optimize Separation`) or execute a single step
of optimization (:obj:`Single Step`). The result of the optimization may depend
on the initial placement of the anchors, which can be set in a circle,
arbitrary or even manually (:obj:`Set anchor positions`). The later also works
at any stage of optimization, and we recommend to play with this option in
order to understand how a change of one anchor affects the positions of the
data points. Controls in :obj:`Forces` box are used to set the parameters that
define the type of the forces between the data points (see [1]_).
In any linear projection, projections of unit vector that are very short
compared to the others indicate that their associated attribute is not very
informative for particular classification task. Those vectors, that is, their
corresponding anchors, may be hidden from the visualization using controls in
:obj:`Show anchors` box.

The other two, quite prominent visualization methods, are accessible through
FreeViz's :obj:`Dimensionality Reduction` tab (not shown here). These includes
supervised principal component analysis and partial least squares method.
The general objection of these two approaches is the same as for FreeViz
(find a projection that separates data instances of different class), but the
results - because of different optimization methods and differences in their
bias - may be quite different.

The fourth projection search technique that can be accessed from this widget
is VizRank search algorithm with RadViz visualization ([4]_). This is
essentially the same visualization and projection search method as implemented
in :ref:`Radviz`.

Like other point-based visualization widget, Linear Projection also includes
explorative analysis functions (selection of data instances and zooming).
See documentation for :ref:`Scatter Plot` widget for documentation of these as
implemented in :obj:`Zoom / Select` toolbox in the :obj:`Main` tab of the
widget.
