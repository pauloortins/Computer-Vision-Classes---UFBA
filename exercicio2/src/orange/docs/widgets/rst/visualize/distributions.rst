Distributions
=============

Displays value distributions for a single attribute.

Signals

Inputs:
   - Examples (ExampleTable)
      Input data set.


Outputs:
   - (None)


Description
-----------

Distributions displays the value distribution of either discrete or continuous
attributes. If the data contains class, the distributions are conditioned on
the class.

   :alt: Distribution for a discrete feature

For discrete attributes, the graph displayed by the widget shows how many times
(e.g., in how many data instances) each of the attribute values appear in the
data. If the data contains a class variable, class distributions for each of
the attribute values will be displayed as well (like in the snapshot above).
The widget may be requested to display only value distributions for instances
of certain class (:obj:`Outcomes`). For class-valued data sets, the class
probability conditioned on a specific value of the attribute
(:obj:`Target value`) may be displayed as well.

   :alt: Distribution for a continuous feature

For continuous attributes, the attribute values are discretized and value
distribution is displayed as a histogram. Notice that the :obj:`Number of bars`
can be used to alter the discretization used. Class probabilities for the
continuous attributes are obtained through loess smoothing, the appearance of
the curve and inclusion of the confidence intervals are set in
:obj:`Probability plot` settings.

Notice that in class-less domains, the bars are displayed in gray and no
additional information (e.g. conditional probabilities) are available.
