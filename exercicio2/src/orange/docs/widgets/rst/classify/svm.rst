Description
-----------

Support vector machines (SVM) is a popular classification technique that will
construct a separating hyperplane in the attribute space which maximizes the
margin between the instances of different classes. The technique often yields
supreme predictive performance results. Orange embeds a popular implementation
of SVM in `LIBSVM`_ package, and this widget provides for a graphical user
interface to its functionality. It also behaves like a typical Orange
learner widget: on its output, it presents an object that can learn and is
initialized with the setting specified in the widget, or, given the input
data set, also a classifier that can be used to predict classes and class
probabilities given a set of new examples.

Learner can be given a name under which it will appear in other widgets that
use its output, say, in :ref:`Test Learners`. The default name is simply "SVM".

The next block of options deals with kernel, that is, a function that
transforms attribute space to a new feature space to fit the maximum-margin
hyperplane, thus allowing the algorithm to create non-linear classifiers.
The first kernel in the list, however, is a :obj:`Linear` kernel that does
not require this trick, but all the others (:obj:`Polynomial`, :obj:`RBF`
and :obj:`Sigmoid`) do. Specific functions that specify the kernel are
presented besides their names, and the constants involved:

:obj:`g` for the gamma constant in kernel function (the recommended value
is 1/k, where k is the number of the attributes, but since there may be no
training set given to the widget the default is 0 and the user has to set
this option manually), :obj:`d`) for the degree of the kernel (default 3),
and :obj:`c` for the constant c0 in the kernel function (default 0).

:obj:`Options` control other aspects of the SVM learner.
:obj:`Model complexity (C)` (penalty parameter), :obj:`Tolerance (p)` and
:obj:`Numeric precision (eps)` are options that define the optimization
function; see `LIBSVM`_ for further details. The other three options are used
to instruct the learner to prepare the classifier such that it would estimate
the class probability values (:obj:`Estimate class probabilities`), constrain
the number of the support vectors which define the maximum-margin hyperplane
(:obj:`Limit the number of support vectors`) and normalize the training and
later the test data (:obj:`Normalize data`). The later somehow slows down the
learner, but may be essential in achieving better classification performance.

The last button in the SVM dialog is :obj:`Automatic parameter search`. This
is enabled when the widget is given a data set, and uses `LIBSVM`_'s procedures
to search for the optimal value of learning parameters. Upon completion, the
values of the parameters in the SVM dialog box are set to the parameters found
by the procedure.

Examples
--------

There are two typical uses of this widget, one that uses it as a classifier
and the other one that uses it to construct an object for learning. For the
first one, we have split the data set to two data sets (:obj:`Sample` and
:obj:`Remaining Examples`). The sample was sent to :obj:`SVM` which produced
a :obj:`Classifier`, that was then used in :ref:`Predictions` widget to
classify the data in :obj:`Remaning Examples`. A similar schema can be
used if the data would be already separated in two different files; in
this case, two :ref:`File` widgets would be used instead of the
:ref:`File` - :ref:`Data Sampler` combination.

The second schema shows how to use the :obj:`SVM` widget to construct the
learner and compare it in cross-validation with :ref:`Majority` and
:ref:`k-Nearest Neighbours` learners.

The following schema observes a set of support vectors in a :ref:`Scatter Plot`
visualization.

For the above schema to work correctly, the channel between :ref:`SVM`
and :ref:`Scatter Plot` widget has to be set appropriately. Set the channel
between these two widgets by double-clinking on the green edge between the
widgets, and use the settings as displayed in the dialog below.
