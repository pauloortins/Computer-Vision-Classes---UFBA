Description
-----------

Random forest is a classification technique that proposed by
[Breiman2001]_, given the set of class-labeled data, builds a set of
classification trees. Each tree is developed from a bootstrap sample
from the training data. When developing individual trees, an arbitrary
subset of attributes is drawn (hence the term "random") from which the best
attribute for the split is selected. The classification is based on the
majority vote from individually developed tree classifiers in the forest.

Random forest widget provides for a GUI to Orange's own implementation of
random forest (:class:`~Orange.ensemble.forest.RandomForestLearner`). The
widget output the learner, and, given the training data on its input, the
random forest. Additional output channel is provided for a selected
classification tree (from the forest) for the purpose of visualization
or further analysis.

In the widget, the first field is used to specify the name of the learner
or classifier. Next block of parameters tells the algorithm how many
classification trees will be included in the forest
(:obj:`Number of trees in forest`), and how many attributes will be
arbitrarily drawn for consideration at each node. If the later is not
specified (option :obj:`Consider exactly ...` left unchecked), this number
is equal to square root of number of attributes in the data set. Original
Brieman's proposal is to grow the trees without any pre-prunning, but since
this later often works quite well the user can set the depth to which the
trees will be grown (:obj:`Maximal depth of individual trees`). As another
pre-pruning option, the stopping condition in terms of minimal number of
instances in the node before splitting can be set. Finally, if the training
data is given to the widget, the :obj:`Index of the tree on the output`
can be specified, instructing the widget to send the requested classifier.

Examples
--------

Snapshot below shows a standard comparison schema of a random forest and
a tree learner (in this case, C4.5) on a specific data set.

A simple use of this widget where we wanted to explore how do the actual
trees in the forest look like is presented in the following snapshot. In
our case, the 5-th tree from the forest was rendered in the Classification
Tree Graph widget.
