Signals

Inputs:
   - Examples (ExampleTable)
      A table with training examples


Outputs:
   - Association Rules
      Induced rules.



Description
-----------

This widget runs several algorithms for induction of association rules:
the original Agrawal's algorithm for sparse data sets, a modified version
by Zupan and Demsar which is more suitable for the usual machine learning
data, and, finally, an algorithm which induces classification rules where
the right-hand side of the rule is always the class attribute.

The first check box, :obj:`Induce classification rules` allows you to specify
the algorithm to use. If checked, the original Agrawal's algorithm is
used, which is designed for (very) sparse data sets. If clear, it will
use an algorithm which works better on the usual machine learning data where
each example is described by a (smaller) list of attributes and there are
not many missing values.

Next, you can decide whether to :obj:`Induce classification rules` or
ordinary association rules. The former always have the class attribute
(and nothing else) on the right-hand side. You can combine this with any
of the above two algorithms.

As for pruning, you can specify the :obj:`Minimal support` and
:obj:`Minimal confidence`, where support is percentage of the entire
data set covered by the (entire) rule and the confidence is the proportion
of the number of examples which fit the right side among those that fit the
left side. The running time depends primarily on the support.

If support is set too low, the algorithm may find too many rules and
eventually run out of memory. For this reason the number of rules is
by default limited to 10000. You can increase the limit at a risk of
running out of memory.

:obj:`Build rules` runs the algorithm and outputs the induced rules.

Examples
--------

This widget is typically used with the :ref:`Association Rules Filter`
and/or :ref:`Association Rules Explorer`. One possible schema is shown below.
